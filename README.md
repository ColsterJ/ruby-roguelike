# ruby-roguelike

This is a modified version of the Roguelike game from Academy Pittsburgh Session 9 Week 3. This version uses graphical display instead of using the text-based console, and also has sound effects.

This code uses a library called [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/index.html) to handle graphics, sound, and input. You must install it before running the script.

## Installing Gosu on Windows
Simply type this into a command line:
```
gem install gosu
```

## Installing Gosu on a Mac
If you are running this on a Mac, see [this page](https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-OS-X) for installation instructions.

## Running Ruby-Roguelike
Once Gosu is installed, you should clone the repository, then you can run ruby-roguelike like any other script.
```
git clone https://github.com/coljonesdev/ruby-roguelike.git
cd ruby-roguelike
ruby roguelike.rb
```
Use the WASD or Arrow keys to move the player, press 'T' to switch fonts, or press 'Q' to quit.
